# NodeMCU-Python-Lock

OTP Authentication Lock Using NodeMCU and Python

This project implements a secure OTP-based authentication system for a lock, using NodeMCU and Python. It allows an admin to generate a unique OTP that, when correctly entered by the user, triggers the lock to open. This IoT-based system is ideal for enhancing security in physical spaces, requiring both network integration and secure code to ensure reliable operation.

Features:

OTP Generation and Verification: Admin generates an OTP, which the user must enter to unlock.
NodeMCU Integration: Uses NodeMCU to manage network communication and lock control.
Python Backend: Python scripts handle OTP generation and manage the verification process.
Security Focused: Designed for secure access with easy-to-understand code.
